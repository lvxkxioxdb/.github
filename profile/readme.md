Just walked out of Flight Risk, and let me tell ya, I don't even know where to start. First of all, I came into this thing half-awake after a brutally long week, and now I'm both awake and kinda messed up in the head. This film, man... itâ€™s like they took a 747, put it in a blender, and hit pulse.

So the plotâ€”itâ€™s all over the place but in this fever-dream, sweaty-palmed kind of way. One minute youâ€™re all cozy, thinking it's going to be a typical sky-high cat-and-mouse drama, then bam! It hits you with some existential stuff that makes you question your life's choices as if you're deciding on whether to download the movie or not but somehow ends up being about tofu and the existential dread of maybe getting on a plane to nowhere.

> At one point, I swear, the lead actorâ€™s eyebrows were telling a completely different story from the dialogue. It was like watching two movies at once. How do you even do that? And the sound editing! Good lord, I spent half the movie wondering if my ears were broken or if the theater was secretly channeling the energy of an angry wasp nest.

The script, honestly, was like a mad hatter's tea party of words. Just when you think the flight is smooth, and you're finally unwinding, they hit you with this line thatâ€™s both profound and laughably out of place. Gravity? Who needs it when you've got dialogue floating around like balloons tied to nothing whatsoever?

And speaking of flight, every time they cut to the cockpit, I imagined myself as a programmer, and this popped into my head: 

```c
#include <stdio.h>
#define PILOT_SMILE 10

int main() {
    printf(Autopilot engaged: %d, PILOT_SMILE);
    return 0;
}
```

Yup, that's right. Completely useless, but somehow fitting. Trying to explain why this came to mind is like trying to elaborate on why cats hate waterâ€”there's no end to it, and you just end up with a scratch or two.

In conclusion (if there even is one), Flight Risk is a wild ride. You get off the plane, and youâ€™re not sure whether to applaud or just vigorously shake the flight attendant's hand for surviving the trip. Should you watch the movie? Only if you're prepared for a ride where your brain is the one experiencing turbulence.
